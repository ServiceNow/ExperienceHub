## Method Overview
It is often difficult for teams to move beyond a punch list of problems to fix and focus on envisioning a better tomorrow. By reframing the problems into How Might We… statements teams can then apply the platform’s capabilities to achieve the business’ outcome.

“How Might We…” statements need to create inspiration for a broad range of possible solutions. They shouldn’t solve the problem themselves, nor should they be too aspirational that the team can’t achieve them.

### Example
**Too Narrow:** “How might we use a record producer to collect information?”

**Too Broad:** “How might we make it easier?”

**Ideal:** “How might we collect the right information from the user to keep the process moving forward?

## Outcomes
* Prioritized list of areas to focus
* Team focused on moving forward rather than looking back

## Prerequisites
* Identified long term goals for a process or business model (See: Long Term Goals / Challenges)
* Prioritized list of current state challenges (See: Challenges and Friction & Prioritization)

## Participants
Ideally this is conducted with participants that interact with the process or business model and leadership sponsoring the transformation.

## Materials Needed
* Sticky Notes
* Sharpies
* Wall or Whiteboard

## Process
1.	Make sure all participants can see the prioritized challenges and the long-term goals
2.	Hand out 5 sticky notes to each participant.
3.	Ask each participant to write “HMW” at the top of each note
4.	Give participants 5 minutes to complete the sentence “How Might We…”

2.	Avoid suggesting a solution in your HMW question
3.	Keep your HMWs broad
4.	Focus your HMWs on the Desired Outcome
